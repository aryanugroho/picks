Using JSON Schema's

Lets suppose you are recieving a json message roughly of format:

    {
      'id' : 'abc-123',
      'account' : {
          'id' : 'acc-123',
          'name' : 'Codemancers'
      },
      'resource' : {
          'id' : 'srv-123',
          'name' : 'Codemancers CI server'
      }
    }


When processing this incoming json you know that 'id' field must be present, similary
`account` field must have and `id` and there must be a `resouce` field and that field
must have an `id` field too. Traditionally we solve this by using if/elses and rejecting
the json if it is missing some fields. For example:

    json_data = JSON.parse(imcoming_string)
    return if json_data['id'].blank || json_data['account'].blank? || ...


A really approach of solving this problem is to use [json schemas](http://json-schema.org/).
With them I can define a schema for above json:

    {
        'type' : 'object',
        'properties' : {
          'id' : { 'type' : 'string'},
          'account': {
              'type' : 'object',
              'properties' : {
                  'id' : {'type' : 'string'},
                  'name': {'type' : 'string'}
              },
              'required': ['id']
          }
        },
        required: ['id', 'account', 'resource']
    }

And then rather than playing whack-a-mole with incoming json, using the gem https://github.com/hoxworth/json-schema we can do:

    JSON::Validator.validate(schema, data)

and boom code is much simpler and more exhaustive.
