Not sure if everyone knows this, but there's a way to enable debug logs
in node processes using the DEBUG environment variable. It outputs a lot
of—sometimes—useful information about the running process. Each log
message will be prepended by the module name usually. For example:



    send pipe "/Users/kashyap.k/flipkart/fk-cp-zion/build/fk-cp-zion/js/Product.js.map" +0ms
    send modified Sun, 11 Dec 2016 11:00:05 GMT +0ms
    send etag W/"c9656-158ed8a2b08" +0ms
    send content-type application/json +0ms
    compression gzip compression +1ms
    express:router dispatching GET /osdd.xml?v=2 +391ms


To enable this, use `DEBUG=* node <server or program>`. The `*` can be
replaced by a specific module flag if you want to isolate the
information about just one module. For instance:


    > DEBUG='express:router' node server

Will output logs that result only from express router. More information
about using the express-level debug information here: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/debugging.html
