# Error handers for rails ujs actions

If you include `jquery_ujs`, through `jquery-rails` gem, then you can use those
funky `data-remote` methods. One common thing that I have seen (maybe its just
me), is we let such links/buttons/forms submit request to server, but we dont
check for any errors.

Infact, that gem triggers nice events which can be hooked onto. This is how
we can install a error handler, which displays a flash message if `data-remote`
ajax request did not succeed.


```coffee
# bind global ajax error handler for showing better errors
# https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/wiki/ajax

defaultRailsUjsErrorHandler = (xhr, status) ->
  message = JST['templates/flash']
    message: 'Something went wrong. Please try again'
    alert_class: 'alert-error'
  $('#flash-notice').replaceWith(message)


$(document).on 'ajax:error', defaultRailsUjsErrorHandler
```

And this is the jst template for flash notice

```html
<div id="flash-notice" class="alert-container">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="alert <%- alert_class %>">
      <button type="button" data-dismiss="alert" class="close">Ã—</button>
      <%- message %>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

There are other intersting events that `jquery_ujs` fires. You can read more
about it [here](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/wiki/ajax).
