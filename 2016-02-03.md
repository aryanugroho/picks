Chef-Vault
==========

A chef plugin to manage secrets in chef server. This automatically encrypts
and stores your data in data bags, and allows decrypting in nodes.
Here's a [blog post](http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2013/09/10/managing-secrets-with-chef-vault/)

Nice YACC tutorial
==================

YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) is a parser generator.
It takes a grammar written in BNF and generates a parser that can read
source written in that grammar and give us a parse tree. Elixir uses this
behind the scenes in its compiler to from the syntax tree and compile the source
for the Erlang VM.

I stumbled across a nice tutorial for YACC which will help you brush up your
compiler lessons from college : [YACC tutorial](http://epaperpress.com/lexandyacc/download/LexAndYaccTutorial.pdf).
