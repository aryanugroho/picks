rspec generic matcher

let us say we want to write an api spec for an interface  
test should be that a value can be this or that 
"0" or "1" as string in this case

can we written with `rpsec` `satisfy` matcher
https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers/satisfy-matcher

```ruby
  expect(prescription["isExpired"])
    .to satisfy { |s| ['0', '1'].include?(s) }
```

is pretty generic
