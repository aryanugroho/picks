#### Depending on configuration in tests

Quite often rails projects depend on a `config.yml` and values within it for functioning.
What seems innocus at first, we start depending on values within `config.yml` in our
unit tests as well. For example, if `config.yml` defines `app_email` as `foo@example.com`
then tests depend on that value being `foo@example.com`.

What I am slowly beginning to realize (working on Brightbox project) is - depending on
values within `config.yml` in specs is really a anti-pattern. Not only now specs require
a proper `config.yml` for running the tests, but also - sometimes values present in `config.yml`
can dictate the behaviour of unit test itself.

A solution that we are working to use in Brightbox is to use `configatron.temp` and remove dependence on `config.yml` altogether. For example:

    # in spec_helper.rb
    config.around(:each) do |example|
      configatron.temp do
        .. set values required here
        yield
      end
    end

This has the benefit that, tests run in a uniform environment across the board. People
often have different values in `config.yml` locally.


This also ensures that whatever setup we require for proepr `config.yml` can be performed
in `around(:each)` block.
