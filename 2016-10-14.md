## Catch timing issues in Elixir/OTP by using "+T 9"

#### - Emil

It's common to see this kind of code:

```elixir
# Example 1
# Children of a supervision tree
children = [
  worker(A, [name: A]), # Depends on B
  worker(B), [name: B]), # Depends on C
  worker(C, [name: C])
]
```

also, code like this one here:

```elixir
# Example 2
{:ok, pid} = GenServer.start(MyModule, args)
ref = Process.monitor(pid)

receive do
  {:DOWN, ^ref, _, _, :normal} ->
    # Handle pid exiting
end
```

You may also have passing tests for the code above.
But there are problems with this code which will probably come alive and bite
you only when running this code on a machine with real load. Spot the problem
yet? Timing issues.

Let's look at example 1. In an ideal scenario, all of them will be started
in an instant and they will be able to talk to each other and everything
works as expected. But remember that supervisors always start children in the
order in which they appear in the list. So A is started first, then B, and lastly C.
If by chance there is a delay in B or C starting up, The dependent worker will
try to send messages using the name "B" or "C", but the process may not exist
yet, which would throw an exception, killing the calling process.

What about example 2? By the time `Process.monitor(pid)` gets executed, the
spawned process may have exited normally. This would cause `Process.monitor(pid)` to
immediately send a `DOWN` message with a reason set to `:noproc`. So
we would never receive the message for the normal shutdown of the GenServer.

These kind of timing issues are very common when writing supervision trees
or spawning processes and maintaining relationships between spawned processes.
To help find these problems in tests, erlang provides a command line option
`+T`.

### What's +T?

+T accepts a number between 0 and 9 and it causes delays between spawning
switching among processes. The degree of delay depends on the number that's
passed as the argument. This means, in the above examples, with "+T 9",
the compiler may delay the spawning of the children in the supervision tree
in the first example or it may cause delay before switching to parent
after spawning the GenServer in the second example.

To use this option when running elixir tests, just run `ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS="+T 9" mix test`.
It's a good idea to set this environment variable in CI such as Travis.


## Writing feature specs with Rspec & Capybara

#### - Atul

* After installing Rspec and Capybara, generate feature spec with :
```VimL
rails g rspec:feature User
```
* Mocking omniauth sign_in:

First create a user and then call the omniauth stub.

```ruby
before do
  FactoryGirl.create(:user, email: 'test@test.com')
  stub_omniauth
  visit new_user_session_path
  click_link 'Sign In with Google'
end

def stub_omniauth(email: 'test@test.com')
  OmniAuth.config.test_mode = true
  OmniAuth.config.add_mock(:google_oauth2, {:uid => '12345'})
end
```

Reference - https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Integration-Testing

* Building webpack:

If you have webpack configured in your application then while running integration spec build it before running the test suite.

```ruby
# task
namespace :webpack do
  task :build do
    system("npm run build")
  end
end

# rails_helper
config.before(:suite) do
  Rake::Task['webpack:build'].invoke
end
```
