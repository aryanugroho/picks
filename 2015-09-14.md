Pairing with Wemux
===================

Just for future reference, here are the steps for pairing with wemux:

On host:
1. Install wemux
2. Create a new user on the OS, called 'pair'
3. Add client's SSH public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of 'pair' user we just created. Make sure sshd is running
4. Log out of pair user, run `wemux start` as normal user.

On client:
1. Run `ssh pair@<ip_of_host_on_lan>` (Use hamachi if doing this remotely)
2. Once logged in as 'pair' user, run `wemux attach`

Protip:

To logout attached clients after pairing, on the host:

1. Run `ps aux | egrep "sshd: [a-zA-Z]+@"` to see the list of ssh'ed users.
2. Run `kill -9 <pid_of_sshd>` to kill ssh session. Get `pid_of_sshd` from step 1.
