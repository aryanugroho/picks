Mysql views are updatable. I always thought views are not updatable, but
apparently I am wrong - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/view-updatability.html

So some views are updatable as long as, there is one to one mapping between table
and the view and view does not uses aggregate functions.

#### Mysql int(1) or int(10) is same####

apparently int(1) or int(10) is same and what you declare the
integer to be matters. 1 or 10 is used only for display purpose.
