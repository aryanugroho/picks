Go's if-condition scoped sentences
==================================

Go has this nifty feature where you can start the if condition with a statement.
Anything defined in the statement will be scoped till the end of if block only.

For example:

```go
if user := user.Save(params); user.isValid {
  //Redirect using user object
} else {
  //Set errors using user object
}
```
