# Direnv

[Direnv](https://github.com/zimbatm/direnv) is a tool to setup directory
specific environment vars. I use it for adding "./bin" to $PATH when using
binstubs. Direnv will make sure the environment is loaded when cd-ing into
the project directory.

Setup :

    brew install direnv
    cd rails_project
    direnv edit .
    # Add text "PATH_add bin" and save
    # Done !
