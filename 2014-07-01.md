# Ionic framework for mobile app development

This framework looks promising, i was trying out a sample app, and its
very easy to get started. It has angular integration also. So, write
a js app, and then convert it to mobile app.

# Ionicons

This set of icons look pretty good. I think they are good alternative
to font-awesome
