Write Barriers in Generational Garbage Collections

A generational garbage collector requires write barriers because
when HEAP is split into young and old and younger generation needs
GCed more often, there is a potential problem that - an object in
young generation may be referened by an object in old generation.

So to mark a object in young generation for garbage collection, we must ensure that:

a. No other object references this object in younger generation.
b. No other object references this object from older generation.

But traversing all of old generation just for checking if an object in old generation
holds reference to this object defeats the point of generational GC.

Thats where Write barriers or remembered Sets come in. What is done here is, whenever
a new object is referenced by an object in old generation such as:

```ruby
old_hash["name"] = "Codemancers tech"
```

the hash is marked in an area called write barrier (or remembered set). This way,
objects in remembered set are scanned in addition to objects in younger generation
during minor GC.
