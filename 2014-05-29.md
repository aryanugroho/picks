An interesting blog post about user_id, effective user id and how just changing
effective user id via `Process::UID.change_privilege` can lead to security bugs:

A sorta corollary to above pick is, we are used to finding home directory of
user via `Dir.home` or `ENV['HOME']` but apparently in some cases they can return
wrong result, another way is:

```
Etc.getpwuid(Process.uid).dir
```
