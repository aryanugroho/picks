A good read. One guys story about Silicon valley. 
Liked the story itself and liked some of the smaller facts themself.

If you are using `rbenv` and there is a lag while opening a new shell, consider
updating the `eval "$(rbenv init - --no-rehash)"` call with the following -

```
eval "$(rbenv init - --no-rehash)"
```

The `--no-rehash` flag tells `rbenv` to skip automatic rehash when opening a new
shell and speeds up the process. This also speeds up VIM if you are using
[vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) or
[vim-ruby](https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby).
