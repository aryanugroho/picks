Brunch
======

I recently discovered a front end build tool called Brunch which is kind of like
sprockets but much faster and can be used to build front end assets for any
kind of framework. Some of the features that I like :

1. Not a task runner, no build pipeline. Made for "front end asset compilation"
   and only that.
2. Has an option to set a server command. So if you set it to "rails s" and if
   you run `brunch watch --serve`, it will start watching for file changes and
   keep compiling incrementally, while running the rails server. I just ran it
   with "ionic serve" and it worked well.
3. Plugins to compile coffeescript, sass, less etc which work with zero config.
4. Wraps everything in a CommonJS module and browserifies the "require" function
   so you can require and use modules in the browser like you would in Node.
