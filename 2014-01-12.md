#### Tmux layouts with tmuxinator

Finally this time, I'm sold on tmux after I used [tmuxinator](https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator)
to configure tmux layouts. The default layout didn't work for me, I wanted more control on the split
panes. Here's how you can fine tune your tmux layout:

1. Add this to your `~/.tmux.conf` -> `set -g mouse-resize-pane on`
2. Start tmux, split panes, resize panes with mouse to your liking
4. On your shell, run `tmux list-windows` to list active tmux windows and their layouts
5. Copy paste the layout in tmuxinator project file

Also, if you want to customize the tmux status bar colors, use this script on your shell to print all 256 colors.

```bash
for i in {0..255} ; do
    printf "\x1b[38;5;${i}mcolour${i}\n"
done
```
