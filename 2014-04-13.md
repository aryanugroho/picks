### Electronic music for productivity

- Emil

I am not a big fan of electronic music most times, but recently I stumbled upon
[this grooveshark broadcast](http://grooveshark.com/#!/writhem/broadcast) which
claims to help you get your work done, especially if your work is programming.
It has selected tracks which keep the energy high so you keep
doing what you were doing without switchig context but not distracting enough
to steal your focus. I think after listening to this music I can debug and/or
profile code just by looking at it #yuvafacts
