what an article!

three examples here, but the most hilarious is that Facebook is most stable when...  
people are not actively modifying the system :-)

http://jsnice.org

the goal is to take a piece of javascript code 
and de-obfuscate like a person

the framework is given in http://www.nice2predict.org

tested it with a simple Fibonacci function  
and the function argument was given as `x` or `dataAndEvents`
so i guess, it only takes as argument the function signature
and not the function body. not sure
