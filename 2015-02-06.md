`white-space: nowrap;`


This CSS directive ensures that line breaks don't break in between
sentences. This is helpful on <code> inline elements which often have a
single command. For example, consider a post that has this sentence
where the `|` symbol denotes the end of the container (div/p etc):


...............Use the command <brew install |
offlineimap> to install the offlineimap tool |


(Note that this representation is the HTML source, `<...>` is short for
<code>...</code>)


By using that property, it will ensure that the entire line `brew install offlineimap`
will be on a single line.

...............Use the command               |
<brew install offlineimap> to install the    |
offlineimap tool                             |
