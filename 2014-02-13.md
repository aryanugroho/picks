#### Prototype chain lookup in Javascript

$scope is an important thing in AngularJS. That's what makes data binding possible.
Scope makes use of prototypical inheritence when it's passed around, and this is
a source for many subtle bugs because prototype chain in JS is somewhat confusing.
Angular wiki has a good writeup about the prototype chain with diagrams to easily
understand this concept. Check it out [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes).
