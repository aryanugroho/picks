```javascript

export const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'x-user-agent': 'some complicated user agent string here'
}

export default const baseConfig = {
  headers: headers,
  protocol: 'https',
  hostname: 'www.flipkart.com'
}

```

is a common file for AJAX configuration. There's a interface around the
`window.fetch` API that's called ApiCaller. It has methods like `get`,
`post`. So the way a request is made is:

```javascript

import baseconfig from 'utils/baseConfig';

const settings = Object.assign({}, baseconfig, { pathname: 'some/api/v3/url' });
ApiCaller.get(settings)
```

Now, there's a code path that calls an external URL for some token. And
that `x-user-agent` header is not required for this service; it's
internal to FK. So, the code for this call was written as this:

```javascript

import baseconfig from 'utils/baseConfig';

const settings = Object.assign({}, baseconfig, { pathname: 'some/api/v3/url', hostname: 'www.someexternal.com' });
delete settings.headers['x-user-agent'];
ApiCaller.get(settings)
```

This is a huge bug that's hard to find since the first bunch of requests
work fine. Only when there's a call to this particular API endpoint does
the header gets deleted, and any further requests to FK internal APIs
fail. `Object.assign` is a shallow clone. So when the second-level item
is deleted, it's actually deleting from the object that's being referred
to in the shallow cloned result. The fix for this is:

```javascript

import baseconfig, { headers } from 'utils/baseConfig';

const baseHeaders = Object.assign({}, headers);
delete baseHeaders['x-user-agent'];

const settings = Object.assign({}, baseconfig, { headers: baseHeaders, pathname: 'some/api/v3/url', hostname: 'www.someexternal.com' });
ApiCaller.get(settings)
```


So beware when you find yourself or someone else writes a code that
similar to:

```javascript
delete something.somethingElse['key']
```
