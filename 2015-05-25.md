Postgres has a `DISTICT ON` query clause that lets you select the first
row per group pretty quickly:

Say we have a logger or reporting table that has the following items:


UserName                 Time

kgrz                     10:00AM
iffyuva                  10:00AM
kgrz                     10:10AM
kgrz                     10:10AM


Let's say we need to pick up the last login time per user, we'd normally
use a `group by` and then order the `Time` column and fetch the first using
`LIMIT`. `DISTINCT ON` does this even quicker without the overhead of a
full table scan—with a proper index—which is the case with the former
even with a well-designed index.
