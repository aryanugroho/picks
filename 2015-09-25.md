Ordering in JS objects (hash) should not be depended upon when the keys
are numerical:

a = {}
a['2'] = 124
a['1'] = 125

console.log(a)
=> {1: 125, 2: 124}

expected: {2: 124, 1: 125}

Note that using the `a['key']` syntax, type coercion happens and the
value gets converted to an integer. For example:

a = {}
a['1'] = 123

a.1 => Syntax error
a.'1' => Syntax error
a['1'] => 123
a[1]   => 123; expected: nil


This is the central problem in this issue:
https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/2231


Rails admin stores the elements of the multiselect field in an object
called `_cache` when pre-fetching of the list items is enabled. While
populating this `_cache` object, the keys are of the form: '<int>'. These
get coerced to an int and the resultant `_cache` object gets sorted in a
different manner than the insertion order. This causes this bug!
