interesting because he comes so strongly against Unit tests
which i guess has gained prominence after DHH's rant about "TDD is dead"

also like how he tries to explain the information (a turing machine which checks another one) 
the tests provide and the focus on business value

I think DHH is dead corrent when he says we need to test features   
just hope what he has in mind is faster though 

rebuttals to DHH article are
http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/01/Design-Damage.html (focus on seperating concerns)
http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/04/25/MonogamousTDD.html (focus on confidence and continuous delivery)
https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2014/tdd-straw-men-and-rhetoric (fast test which feature tests will not provide)

do not like how both of them start by fighting over semantics 
lacks that punch which DHH has :-)
