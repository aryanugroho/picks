Nicely written article on how to upload directly to AWS S3.

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/direct-to-s3-image-uploads-in-rails

using a pre-signed POST url seems like a good way to 
- keep code DRY
- not expose keys in javascript
- not allow public read

there are article for node.js and other frameworks as well

to integrate with Paperclip
- generate the pre-signed url with a UUID as given in the article
- persist the uuid in the database table
- overwrite paperclip asset_host

eg.

```ruby
Paperclip.interpolates :uuid  do |attachment, style|
  attachment.instance.uuid
end

# originally like "attachments/documents/000/000/001/original/est.pdf"
Paperclip.interpolates :asset_host  do |attachment, style|
  uuid = attachment.instance.uuid
  filename = attachment.instance.document_file_name
  "uploads/#{uuid}/#{style}/#{filename}"
end
```
