Here's how to fix it. Go to system preferences -> Network -> Huawei modem. Enable `Show modem
status in menu bar`. After you plug in your device, do not use the bundled software to connect.
Use the modem icon in the status bar to connect and disconnect.

Recently I have switched to tmux and started to automate my workflow
using - https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator.

Using it basically when starting work on a project, with one command
I can have `invoker` running in one window and then in another some
ssh session and then in another something else. Also my tmux configuration
can be found on:

#### Rubocop and Flycheck

[`Flycheck`](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) is a emacs mode which helps
us with IDE like warnings in Emacs. I am already using `enh-ruby-mode` which helps
with some of the syntax errors and stuff, but what is nice about `flycheck` is
it integrates with `rubocop` and shows `rubocop` errors in-place in the editor.

A picture is worth thousand words so:
