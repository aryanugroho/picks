Pitfalls with implicit ordering and indexing
===========================================
(Kashyap)


`Loan` model has the columns: `id`, `created_at` and `user_id`
`User` model has the columns: `id`


Scenario:

* There's one user with two loans. The first loan is rejected and the
  second is in still under application process. That is, LoanA with
  state `rejected` and LoanB with state `incomplete_loan_info`.

There a line in the code that uses the following call:

    resource.loans.first.state != 'rejected'


The intention of the author was to check if there's any previous loan
that is rejected. This depends on implicit ordering of the column data.
The implicit ordering in this scenario is the `.first` method call will
return the earliest loan created (that is, created_at is sorted in asc
order and the head of the array is returned). In this case, the
conditional returns `false`.


Now, without changing any code, and just by adding an index on
`created_at` column, same call returned the latest loan (created_at
sorted in ascending order). That is, after adding an index, the above
conditional returned `true` since the `.first` call now returns LoanB.


In the first case, there was no index on created_at and so the DB does a
sequential scan and returns the first found item. In the second case,
however, since there's an index, the DB chooses to use it and performs
and index based lookup.

This is a gotcha that one needs to keep in mind while writing code that
uses implicit ordering.


Note that this problem is in Rails 3.0. Rails 4 adds an ordering to all
`.first` calls.
