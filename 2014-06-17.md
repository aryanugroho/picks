ssh-copy-id will copy your keys to the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server  
useful for password-less ssh login, of course  

will check if a key already exists before adding it  

can install on OSX using homebrew with:  

```bash
brew install ssh-copy-id
```

can be invoked like:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ivrnet@206.174.214.204
```

Will ask for the user's password on the server  

Now `ssh ivrnet@206.174.214.204` will now ask for the password  
and can see `~/.ssh/autorized_keys` on the server  
Your keys will be included there
