Difference between delete_all and destroy_all
---------------------------------------------

One well known difference between `destroy_all` and `delete_all` is
`destroy_all` will trigger callbacks while `delete_all` will not.

For `has_many`, `destroy` and `destroy_all` will always call the destroy method of the record(s) being removed so that callbacks are run.

However `delete` and `delete_all` will either do the deletion according to the strategy specified by the `:dependent` option, or if no `:dependent` option is given, then it will follow the default strategy. The default strategy is `:nullify` (set the foreign keys to nil), except for `has_many :through`, where the default strategy is `delete_all` (delete the join records, without running their callbacks).
