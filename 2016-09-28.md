### Monkey Patching

You must have heard the word **"Monkey Patching"** in ruby community. It is mostly used by experienced Rubyists and you should be very caution while using it because it is very powerful and can be easily misused.

Ruby is a extremely dynamic language so it allows you to do things on the run time that other languages don't allow.

#### What is Monkey Patching?

Monkey Patching is the ability of modifying the behaviour of a pre-defined class at the runtime.

##### Example:

Consider that you want a method in your `String` class that can tell that if a string is in french or not, so how would you do it?  

You can add this new method by creating a String class and defining your `is_french?` method there.

~~~ruby
class String
  def is_french?
    # Code to check if the string is in french or not goes here...
  end
end
~~~

This will add this `is_french?` method to Ruby's pre-defined `String` class instead of creating a new one.  

Now you can do something like this:  
`“Bonjour”.is_french?` => true  

`“Hello”.is_french?` => false

This is **Monkey Patching**  

Powerful, isn't it? But you should use it with caution because as I told earlier, is can easily be misused.
