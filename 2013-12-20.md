#### Extending pry for Rails Console

Often in Rails I run following command:

    User.find_by_identifier("usr-abcde")

It is especially applicable to `Brightbox Honcho` because each resource there has
a alphanumeric identifier. I got really tired of typing this in console and added following
bit to `.pryrc`:

    if defined?(ActiveRecord::Base)
      class ActiveRecord::Base
        class << self
          def [](id)
            find_by_identifier(id)
          end
        end
      end
    end

With this now I can:

    User["usr-abcde"]
