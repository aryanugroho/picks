The benchmark numbers shown seem awesome  
Not suprising that Clojure peeps are applying persistent data structures everywhere  
It seems to their hammer :-)  
Also am envious how they can write javascript using full clojure  

#### see sql generated by ActiveRecord on console

I have this little snippet in my `.irbrc` file  

```ruby
if defined? ActiveRecord
  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
end
```

Running `ActiveRecord` commands on the console prints the SQL as well.  
useful for learning and debugging

#### Extending pry for frequently run rails method

Often in Rails I run following command:

    User.find_by_identifier("usr-abcde")

It is especially applicable to `Brightbox Honcho` because each resource there has
a alphanumeric identifier. I got really tired of typing this in console and added following
bit to `.pryrc`:

    if defined?(ActiveRecord::Base)
      class ActiveRecord::Base
        class << self
          def [](id)
            find_by_identifier(id)
          end
        end
      end
    end

With this now I can:

    User["usr-abcde"]
