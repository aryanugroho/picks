Sometime you may face a situation when some commit introduces a bug in your app and you have to figure out that commit. Well in that case **Git bisecting** is very useful.  

**Git Bisecting** is an another amazing git command. It helps you to search and mark a bad commit introduced in your branch.

## Git Bisecting:

1. When you discover that something is broken and not working as expected just start bisecting git branch with `git bisect start`

2. Mark your recent commit bad commit by doing `git bisect bad`.

3. Do a `git log` and see which was the last commit you can remember was working fine and copy the `commit-hash`.

4. Mark that commit good by doing `git bisect good commit-hash`. Now git will do a **binary search** between these two commits to find the commit that introduced the problem.

5. Test the current commit and if it looks bad mark it as a bad commit by `git bisect bad` or if it looks good mark it as good by doing `git bisect good`. This will show you the remaining commits to test.

6. Repeat the **Step 5** until there is 0 commits left to test.

7. Once you test everything, the binary search will complete and git will output the commit that caused the problem.

8. Once the process is complete and you find your bad commit, just do `git bisect reset` to come out from the bisecting state.
