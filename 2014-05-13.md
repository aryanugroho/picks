More applicable to C/C++ than Ruby. The other day, I was trying to find a way to print
formatted strings of arbitrary length to a buffer. Something like `sprintf`. The only
problem is - `sprintf` requires a pre-allocated buffer and hence can't be used to
print strings of arbitrary size.

enter `asprintf`. The code goes like:

```
char *name;
asprintf(&name, "name is %s of age %d", "kashyap", 24);
```
