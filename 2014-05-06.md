## Remote pairing with Hamachi

#### - Emil

When you need to quickly pair with someone remotely, it may not be feasible
to set up the whole environment on a pairing server all the time. If you trust
the person you are pairing with, it may be enough that you allow direct SSH access
on your box. Kashyap and I paired a couple of times remotely from home using
Hamachi. Hamachi creates a virtual lan when you don't have
a public facing static IP. Just enable remote login (or start sshd) , add your
colleague's public key to authorized_keys and start Hamachi. He should be able
to SSH into your box and attach to your tmux session.
