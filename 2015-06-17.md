git merge --squash
==================

Offlate I've been using `git merge --squash` to squash commits. It's more
elaborate than the other methods of squashing, but I find it less confusing
and won't screw up your commits if things go south.

```bash
# Your new code is in 'feature' branch.
# Assuming you have merged latest master after resolving conflicts to this branch,
git branch -m feature-original
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b feature
git merge --squash feature-original
```

This squashes your commits, and you have a `feature-original` branch intact
if you screw up.
