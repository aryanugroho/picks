# AR Separating static data

Its pretty interesting read about how sql generation changed overtime, and how
caching sql generation works. Im copy pasting a part of blogpost here:

### Separating Static Data

Let’s consider this statement:

```ruby
  Post.find(params[:id])
```

In previous versions of Rails, when this code was executed, if you watched your
log files, you would see something like this go by:

```sql
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 10
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 12
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 22
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 33
```

In later versions of Rails, you would see log messages that looked something
like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ? [id, 10]
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ? [id, 12]
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ? [id, 22]
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ? [id, 33]
```

This is because we started separating the dynamic parts of the SQL statement
from the static parts of the SQL statement. In the first log file, the SQL
statement changed on every call. In the second log file, you see the SQL
statement never changes.

Now, the problem is that even though the SQL statement never changes, Active
Record still performs all the translations we discussed above. In order to
gain speed, what do we do when a known input always produces the same output?
Cache the computation.

Keeping the static data separated from the dynamic data allows AdequateRecord
to cache the static data computations. What's even more cool is that even
databases that don’t support prepared statements will see an improvement.
