Shamelessly picked from HN - http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/11/18/best-postgres-feature-youre-not-using/

It is basically a way to create more readable queries. The article talks about
CTEs (Common Table expressions) present in SQL standard which allows us to create
temporary local variable like things from SQL select statements. We can reuse
the created CTEs for simplifying long joins as if they are temporary tables.

As per corresponding discussion on HN - Postgres does not optimizes across
CTEs though. Which means if query Y uses result from CTE X and then X isn't lazily
evalulated but rather results in fetching X before Y can be evaluated. A join on
other hand will only fetch what is absolutely necessary across X and Y.

**Running PostgresSQL database from memory**

I followed following steps:


1. Create a directory for mounting tmpfs partition:

        sudo mkdir -p /mnt/postgres

2. Mount a tmpfs partition there:

        sudo mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/postgres -o size=5000m,nr_inodes=8k,mode=0700

3. Change ownership of created partition:

        sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /mnt/postgres

4. Create Postgres data directory:

    su - postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/9.3/bin/initdb -D /mnt/postgres"

5. Adjust settings of cluster so as it works better with in memory databases:

    fsync=off fsync = off
    synchronous_commit=off synchronous_commit = off
    full_page_writes=off full_page_writes = off
    bgwriter_lru_maxpages=0 bgwriter_lru_maxpages = 0

6. Start Postgres Server:

    su - postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/9.3/bin/pg_ctl -D /mnt/postgres -l logfile start"

7. Create a new user for running with jenkins:

    ~> sudo su -l postgres
    ~> psql
    postgres=# create role jenkins superuser;
    postgres=# ALTER ROLE jenkins WITH LOGIN;
    postgres=# ALTER ROLE jenkins WITH CREATEDB;

8. You should have postgres running from memory.
