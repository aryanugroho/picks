Shamelessly picked from HN - http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/11/18/best-postgres-feature-youre-not-using/

It is basically a way to create more readable queries. The article talks about
CTEs (Common Table expressions) present in SQL standard which allows us to create
temporary local variable like things from SQL select statements. We can reuse
the created CTEs for simplifying long joins as if they are temporary tables.

As per corresponding discussion on HN - Postgres does not optimizes across
CTEs though. Which means if query Y uses result from CTE X and then X isn't lazily
evalulated but rather results in fetching X before Y can be evaluated. A join on
other hand will only fetch what is absolutely necessary across X and Y.
