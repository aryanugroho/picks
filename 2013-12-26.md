#### Watchdog exception handler in sidekiq

I was reading sidekiq source and stumbled across an interesting 'watchdog' pattern for handling exeptions
raised in mission critical parts of the system. Watchdog is nothing but a method :

```ruby
def watchdog(last_words)
  yield
rescue Exception => ex
  handle_exception(ex, { :context => last_words })
  raise ex
end
```

`handle_exception` method is mixed in from the `ExceptionHandler` module, and this method has the responsibility
of doing stuff with the exception, like logging, send to airbrake, etc.

So if you have `something_important` to run, you run it like this :

```ruby
watchdog("This is so important") do
  something_important
end
```

[The Ruby Cross Reference](http://rxr.whitequark.org/mri/ident) is like ctags enabled Ruby internal
code navigation on the browser. Pretty good !
