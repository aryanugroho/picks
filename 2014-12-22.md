Tool for Optimizing PNGs:

There is a pretty neat command-line tool for optimizing PNG files called
optipng. That can be installed via homebrew:

`brew install optipng`

Usage:

    optipng -o7 --keep file.png

the `o7` is the optimization level (in this case, maximum optimization)
and `--keep` lets you take a backup before compressing the image. The
backed up file in this case would be saved as file.png.bak
