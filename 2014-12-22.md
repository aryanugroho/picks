Image optimization tools:
------------------------

Tool for Optimizing SVGs: https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui

Tool for Optimizing PNGs:

There is a pretty neat command-line tool for optimizing PNG files called
optipng. That can be installed via homebrew:

`brew install optipng`

Usage:

    optipng -o7 --keep file.png

the `o7` is the optimization level (in this case, maximum optimization)
and `--keep` lets you take a backup before compressing the image. The
backed up file in this case would be saved as file.png.bak

##### rack_session_access gem

Most of the specs generally start with signing in of user. This
typically invoices these steps:


- visiting landing page
- clicking on login link
- filling in username, and details
- clicking login
- app will populate session, and
- user is redirected to dashboard


If there are lots of feature specs, the above process consumes bit
of time. Effectively what we are doing is just setting `user_id`
in session.


Since capybara wont allow accesing session, we can use this gem
[rack_session_access](https://github.com/railsware/rack_session_access/)
to populate session directly.
