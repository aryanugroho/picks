A funny read. 

```
However, the most important person in my gang will be a systems programmer. 
A person who can debug a device driver or a distributed system is a person who can be trusted in a 
Hobbesian nightmare of breathtaking scope; a systems programmer has seen the terrors of 
the world and understood the intrinsic horror of existence

Strict vs lazy evaluation

Source - [Strict Functions, section 3.3](http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/functions.html)

The section in above link very clearly explains what is lazy evaluation and what is
strict evaluation.

From above link - A function is strict (and not lazy) if given a non-terminating expression
the function itself becomes non-terminating. For example:

```
def printArray arraySequence
  arraySequence.each {|x| puts x}
end
```

Above function is strict because if calling `#each` on `arraySequence` results in
non-terminating expression then function `printArray` becomes non-terminating itself.
