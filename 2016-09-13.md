There would be times when your method are not about interacting with models and database instead they would perform several different tasks eg.  
1. Redirection
2. Performing some checks
3. Simply rendering JS/HTML

In these types of cases you would try to name methods according to the operation they perform and the method name would be

## Best Practices
1. Always follow REST Practices.
2. If you find some method which is not following REST practices and doesn't belong to one of these(index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy) then it is time to stop for a while and extract that method to it's own controller.

~~~ruby
class SessionsController < ApplicationController

  # Code for sessions controller

  def show_timer
    # Code to display timer
  end
end
~~~

##### After Extracting "show_timer" to it's own controller class

~~~ruby
class SessionsController < ApplicationController

  # Code for sessions controller

end

class TimeController < ApplicationController
  def show
    # Code to display timer goes here
  end
end
~~~
