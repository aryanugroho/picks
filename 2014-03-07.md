How to find the source of where a Module was defined if there are no
methods defined inside it but it was included somwhere? Interesting
question.

#### Checking if a process is really running programmatically.

One can use `ps aux` or other stuff, what I have found is following works quite well:

    begin
      Process.kill(0, pid)
    rescue Errno::ESRCH
      # process is not running
    end
