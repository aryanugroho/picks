Perfmap

A JS bookmarklet that overlays a heatmap of resource download times.
Haven't tried this yet but sounds useful. No more opening JS console to
see which request took the most time. As per the description, I think
this shows the timings for resources that can be seen i.e, stuff like
images. I'm assuming the timings for scripts and stylesheets are clubbed
up and shown as one number.
