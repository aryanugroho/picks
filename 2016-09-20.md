Writing cleaner and simpler controller code is always appreciated.
There are some tips that one can follow to write beautiful controllers.

1. Always follow rails convention while writing controller.  
  Your controller should have only seven public actions namely (index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy)

2. If you existing controller doesn't follow above discussed methods then it's time to do some rethinking.

3. Always break an activity or actions in a resource if it doesn't fit in any existing controller following `Rails conventions`.

### Example:
If you want to show user a dashboard page then there are 2 ways to go with this as discussed below.

#### Option 1:
~~~ruby
/app/controllers/pages_controller.rb

class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def dashboard
  end
end

/config/routes.rb

get '/dashboard', to: 'pages#dashboard', as: 'dashboard_path'
~~~

At first it looks a good approach to put the logic to display all the pages under `PagesController` but it clearly violates `rails convention for resourceful controllers`

#### Option 2:
~~~ruby
/app/controllers/dashboards_controller.rb

class DashboardsController < ApplicationController
  def show
  end
end

/config/routes.rb

resources :dashboard, only: [:show]
~~~

Clearly second approach is preferred in rails community, so always choose `Option 2` over `Option 1`.
