Interesting post about importance of DB backups:

The point I liked:

> I HAVE A REPLICA, WHY SHOULD I CARE?

> A replica can be helpful for quick recovery, but can easily have its
data damaged by the same process that damaged the master. Suppose a
command like delete from users; is run against your database. Chances
are good that this statement is going to be processed on your replica
before you even realize you left off the WHERE clause.
In fact, just a couple weeks ago we helped a customer where a rake
db:setup was run against against Production when rake db:migrate
returned structure errors; this actually resets the database using the
structure.rb, so all the database data was lost. The replica dutifully
replicated these statements so the only option was to resort to
restoring the backup.
