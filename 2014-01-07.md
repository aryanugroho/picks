Using Arel for better chainability.

This is probably a know thing, But I had following scope:

    scope :unfinished, where("status not in (?)", DatabaseServer.finished_states)

Which works. But when used in chain, such:

    account.database_servers.unfinished.joins(:database_type => :server_type).all

it throws error:

    "Amgiguous column status"

If you look closely you will see that query generated by `unfinished` scope does
not have `database_servers` prepended because SQL fragment is handrolled. Also `accounts`
table as well has a column called `status` and hence the error when using the scope in a join.

The fix is to use Arel such that:

    scope :unfinished, where(arel_table['status'].not_in DatabaseServer.finished_states)

Which generates proper query with `database_servers` prefixed.
