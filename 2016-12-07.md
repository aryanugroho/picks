Quick Elixir benchmarking
=========================

- Emil

Sometimes you'd want to benchmark a function from iex but you don't want to
stop the node to add a library to do so - for example, when you want to
measure how much time a function takes to do some operations using ETS entries
which you don't want to lose by restarting the node. Use this script to quickly
time the function:

```elixir
defmodule Benchmark do
  def measure(function) do
    function
    |> :timer.tc
    |> elem(0)
    |> Kernel./(1_000_000)
  end
end

# Usage:
Benchmark.measure fn -> MyModule.costly_operaton end
# Returns time in seconds
```
