A small intro to virtual columns in MySQL and MariaDB. Using this, one
can create a virtual column in the same table that keeps it updated with
changes in data. Pretty useful for adding indexes on derived data.
Caveat is that this column, and the columns from which this should be
derived must be in the same table.

A sample use-case for this would be where a query is used to return the
full name based on the last name and first name columns from the DB. A
virtual column can be setup to calculate the full name by concatenating
last and first names appropriately. This derived column can then be used
for fetching the full name directly, and for indexing.
