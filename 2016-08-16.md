This application (written in RoR) searches periodically in various sites
for any chatter about your application, and then doing something about
it. For example, you can setup this application to search Twitter about
integration-diff application to see if anyone's tweeting about some
vulnerability or something, and alert someone from the team.

I stumbled upon that ^ link from this article:

https://github.com/FallibleInc/security-guide-for-developers/blob/master/security-checklist.md

Gives a pretty good checklist of things while working with web
applications.
