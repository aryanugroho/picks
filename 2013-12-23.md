`pry --gem` opens a pry session with `./lib` added to `$LOAD_PATH` and 'require's the gem.
A good shortcut while working on gems and you want a quick console with the gem loaded.

[rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) is a utility to easily manage dotfiles.
There is no need to manually create symlinks or maintain an install script. It
even allows to use multiple dotfiles directly (host specific, multiple source
dir etc). One really nice feature is the ability to track which dotfiles are
symlinked.

Similar to `pry --gem` tip is, ruby has a switch called `-s` which can be used
for running binaries which are present in local directory. for example, if you
are working on `bundler` and want to run `bundle` command with local version of
bundler rather than one installed globally you can use:

    ruby -S ./bin/bundle -I ./lib/ install

Especially useful while developing gems which has binary files.

For simple scripts there isn't much difference between `ruby bin/bundle` and `ruby -S ./bin/bundle`. But to list out things:

a. `ruby -S` allows you to ignore `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` line and even if current version of ruby is X. using `ruby -S` one can run scripts with different version of Ruby. In fact thats how most of jruby scripts are run in production, if not using rvm.

b. I think biggest difference between `ruby -S` and `ruby foo` is, `ruby -S` allows corresponding ruby to change `PATH` and search the program specified from modified PATH. For example -

1. Install JRuby. and just make an alias to jruby

        alias jruby=$HOME/jruby-path/bin/jruby:$PATH:.

2. Now any command run with `jruby -S` should actually use `JRUBY_HOME/bin` binaries, even though `JRUBY_HOME/bin` was not in original shell's PATH. For example, jruby ships with a command called `ast`. which if you run via `ast` will throw error "Command not found". But if you run it via `jruby -S ast` it actually works. Also unlike `jruby ./JRUBY_HOME/bin/ast` with `-S` flag you did not had to specify full path to `ast` script. It automatically picked it up.

3. The reason `ast` command was picked from proper location even if full path to it was not specified in `jruby -S ast` command is because when used with `-S` - `RUBYPATH` environment variable allows `PATH` to be modified before running the command. From docs:

"RUBYPATH - When used with the -S switch on the command line, the paths listed in RUBYPATH will be added to the paths searched when looking for Ruby scripts. The paths in RUBYPATH precede the paths listed in PATH."

4. Using `ruby -S` also kind of helps in environments where shebang lines are not correctly interpreted. `ruby -S` also takes really well whitespaces etc present in `PATH` when starting new command and as such is more portable!
