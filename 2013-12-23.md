`pry --gem` opens a pry session with `./lib` added to `$LOAD_PATH` and 'require's the gem.
A good shortcut while working on gems and you want a quick console with the gem loaded.

[scm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) is a utility to easily manage dotfiles.
There is no need to manually create symlinks or maintain an install script. It
even allows to use multiple dotfiles directly (host specific, multiple source
dir etc). One really nice feature is the ability to track which dotfiles are
symlinked.

### hemant

Similar to `pry --gem` tip is, ruby has a switch called `-s` which can be used
for running binaries which are present in local directory. for example, if you
are working on `bundler` and want to run `bundle` command with local version of
bundler rather than one installed globally you can use:

    ruby -s ./bin/bundle -I ./lib/ install

Especially useful while developing gems which has binary files.
