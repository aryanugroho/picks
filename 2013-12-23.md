`pry --gem` opens a pry session with `./lib` added to `$LOAD_PATH` and 'require's the gem.
A good shortcut while working on gems and you want a quick console with the gem loaded.

[scm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) is a utility to easily manage dotfiles.
There is no need to manually create symlinks or maintain an install script. It
even allows to use multiple dotfiles directly (host specific, multiple source
dir etc). One really nice feature is the ability to track which dotfiles are
symlinked.
