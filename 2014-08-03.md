## Easily switch between WIP git branches

I've been using these scripts to pause and resume changes on WIP branches.

1. [git pause](https://github.com/emilsoman/toolbin/blob/master/git-pause)
2. [git resume](https://github.com/emilsoman/toolbin/blob/master/git-resume)

Really useful if you too think git stash can get messy.
