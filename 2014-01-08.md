Just noticed [Hammerspace](http://nerds.airbnb.com/hammerspace-persistent-concurrent-off-heap-storage/)

Really interesting solution for storing translations out of Ruby HEAP and yet
make them available via simple Ruby hash like interface without involving network
or any kind of Socket IO.

It uses [sparkey](https://github.com/spotify/sparkey) for heavy lifting though.

**Epoll Oneshot**

When using non-blocking IO to build high performance servers one problem people
face is, how to leverage multiple cores available on machine to even speed things up
further.

Usually people come with following solutions

1. Run polling loop in one thread and have a thread pool for off loading long running
processes. No IO is ever performed into polling thread from thread pool threads though and
hence has limited scalability.

2. Another approach is have two separate selectors for Read and writes and hence two different
threads. But this requires careful locking because often you want to observe read or write
events on same file descriptor.

3. [EPOLLONESHOT](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_ctl.2.html) is another approach (which I learnt today morning) which solves this problem elegantly. What it does is - when
you add a file descriptor to monitoring list via `epoll_ctl` you set this flag. And when this
file descriptor is ready with an event (either read, write or connect) then the file descriptor
is automatically disabled for further notifications until it is added back via `epoll_ctl` again.

This allows multiple threads to process events returned by `epoll_wait` because only one thread
will ever receive a file descriptor. More details is explained in this stack overflow thread - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5541054/how-to-correctly-read-data-when-using-epoll-wait
