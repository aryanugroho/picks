Just noticed [Hammerspace](http://nerds.airbnb.com/hammerspace-persistent-concurrent-off-heap-storage/)

Really interesting solution for storing translations out of Ruby HEAP and yet
make them available via simple Ruby hash like interface without involving network
or any kind of Socket IO.

It uses [sparkey](https://github.com/spotify/sparkey) for heavy lifting though.
