Probably known already, but SIL:

```ruby

def Σ(*args)
  puts __callee__
  args.reduce(:+)
end

puts Σ(1,2, 3, 44, 4, 4, 4,)
```

This got a lot of fanfare when Swift was first released. It supported
UTF-8 character method defs unlike Obj-C (if I'm not wrong). We can do
this in Ruby as well. On macs, Ctrl + Cmd + Space can be used to input
these characters easily. Probably not so on other machines.

Also, SIL: Sometime ago I Learned
