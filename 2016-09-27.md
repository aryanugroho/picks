#### Some useful git commands for everyday use

##### git clean -df
This will clean the untracked files and directories from your git repository. The option `d` is for removing directories and `f` is for removing files.

##### git reset --soft <commit-hash>
This will remove all the commits made after the specified commit `<commit-hash>` but will add the files to the staging area so you don't lose your work.

##### git reset <commit-hash>
The default is option is `mixed` if you don't specify any option.  
This will also remove the commits made after the specified commit `<commit-hash>` as above command but the changes will not be staging area, instead they will be in working directory.

##### git reset --hard <commit-hash>
This will also remove all the commits made after the specified commit `<commit-hash>`. This will reset all the changes made to tracked file at the time of the commit `<commit-hash>`. Although the untracked files will still be there which you can remove by `git clean -df`
