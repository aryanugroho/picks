## Find differences between two lists in Elixir
### Emil

Let's say you generated a list of IDs from the DB and you want to compare that
with another list which you already have in your IEx shell and see how the
lists differ. You can do a sort on the IDs and do a vimdiff or something that
highlights the difference, but an easier way to do this from IEx is by making use
of an stdlib function available in the List module named `myers_difference/2`.

From the documentation:

```elixir
List.myers_difference([1, 4, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4])
[eq: [1], del: [4], eq: [2, 3], ins: [4]]
```

The output shows how the first list should be edited to make it look like
the second list.
