Hide-show comments in Emacs. When dealing with files that has long comments
sometimes they can hinder readability of the code. I found `http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HideShow` a god send for such cases.

I can visit a ruby file and press `C-c @ M-C-h` and hide all comments (well they are not
completely hidden but reduced to one line).
