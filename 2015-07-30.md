Better text formatting utility: par

http://www.nicemice.net/par/


Say you have a block of text in your text-editor that needs to be
formatted to not exceed 80 cols, if you do a text-wrapping command, it
would use the system's default formatter like `fmt` on unix machines.
Instead, this program can be used with some configuration depending on
the editor. It seems that this has a better formatter that makes sure
the wrapped block of text doesn't have jagged edges.

To see what that difference is, search for "Examples" in this page:

On vim, it's pretty easy to use this. Add the flag `set formatprg=par\ -w72`
in your VIMRC. And install the `par` program via `brew install par`
