#### [MarkdownHere](http://markdown-here.com/index.html)

It's a browser extension that enables markdown in gmail (also in other places
that allow rich text editing). I've been using this for a couple of years now
especially when composing emails that contain code or other technical details.
It has customizable themes for code highlighting (I use Monokai-Sublime), it
makes code in emails so much more readable.
