#### Copy paste with mouse in Tmux

I feel copying text from console with mouse is much more efficient than the default
`copy mode` of tmux. But if you have enabled any mouse interaction in your tmux conf
( like mouse-select-pane or mouse-select-window ), the default text selection of OSX
would stop working in tmux. I was struggling to find a way to make this work and finally
figured it out. Just keep `option` key pressed while selecting text, simple enough.
