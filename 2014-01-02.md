I was watching this talk linked from [Clean Architecure blog ](http://blog.groupbuddies.com/posts/20-clean-architecture)

[Where TDD went wrong](http://vimeo.com/68375232)

It is a very interesting talk IMO. It does evangelizes BDD, but not completely.
The talk does not advocate the whole outside-in BDD styled testing process.

But what is more interesting is - Ian says, unit testing as we do it - is wrong.
For example - the usual wisdom is, you think of a method and you write test for it and then
you implement the method. If you are not doing TDD, the process is reversed - i.e you implement
the method and you write test for it. But what Ian argues is, this entire approach is wrong.
The idea that, if you have a `user.rb` then there is a `user_spec.rb` is wrong.

He argues that even unit tests should be behaviour based. For example - there should be a
`create_user_spec.rb` and specifies behaviour of when a user is created. If while
implementing `create` method, you require another method - there is no need to unit test
that method separately because behaviour of user creation should cover it.
