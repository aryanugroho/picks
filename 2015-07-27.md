Diffing binary files in Git

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#Binary-Files

Say you want to diff a pdf file. By default, when the file gets
modified, `git diff` will only show that the file has changed, but not
what contents changed. If you wish to see what were the contents
changed, you can tell git to use a program that would convert that
binary format into a text representation. Git would then use that
program, convert the before and after representations into text and then
show the difference on the terminal.

Found this out thanks to: http://zachholman.com/posts/command-line-image-diffs/
which is a nice article in itself. In that example, he uses a program
that displays an image file on the terminal. Since the program needs to
convert the image to text to display it on the terminal, it can be used
by git to show a before and after diff for images on the terminal.

A small list of converters that can be installed as binaries on -nix
machines:

* PDF: pdftotext → Can be installable by `brew` on OSX
* DOC, XLS, PPT, RTF, ODF (ODT, ODS, ODP), OOXML (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX):
  doctotext → Unavailable on OSX via `brew`.
* Jpeg: jp2a → Can be installned by `brew` on OSX
  * spaceman-diff can used to diff images via `git diff`
